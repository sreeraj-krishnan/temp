
I have choosen Node.js as the technology stack because it is single threaded and is asynchronus. 
It can easily do a lot things with very number of lines of code.
Also I'm using redis as the cache in memory and to store the details. I'm using 2 instances of this one for write and one for read which would be the slave.

Requiremets to run the server:
1. Node js
2. redis 

As I don't have a personal Linux system, my development was done in windows through cygwin. If the script does not work then server has to be manually started.
